          <p><em>Founder and CTO of the <strong><a href="https://www.appbrewery.co">App Brewery</a></strong></em></p>
          <p>Ian Makongo is a computing and information systems student who has
          a great need of funds to complete his tiny projects like buying a coach
          for his bedsitter apartment😒 which apparently is being paid for by his
          dad😔. As a result he has opted to visit udemy, enroll for some few courses
          and give his best. He hopes that at the end he will be able to get
          some cash besides getting some really great skills. I wish him the best of luck.
          I think he really needs God's intervention. I mean he is just in is third day
          of his courses and is already behind. I think i have said to much. OOh, and I
          almost forgot....Lemme just shuuuuuurrup!!!MIC DROP.
